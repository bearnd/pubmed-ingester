# pubmed-ingester

## Setup

### Ansible

This project is deployed and provisioned in Vagrant via the `app-pubmed-ingester` Ansible role.

#### Configuration

The role configuration variables can be found under `/roles/app-pubmed-ingester/vars/main.yml`.

##### Ansible-Vault

Sensitive configuration variables, e.g., passwords, are encrypted using `ansible-vault` and placed within the `main.yml` file.

However, these need to be decrypted when provisioning or deploying thus the ansible-vault password used to encrypt them needs to be written out to a `.ansible-vault-password` file at the root of the repository directory. The password needs to be provided by an administrator.

> CAUTION: The `.ansible-vault-password` file should *not* be committed and the filename has been added to `.gitignore`.
